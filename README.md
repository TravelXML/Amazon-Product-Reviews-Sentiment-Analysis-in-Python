![Amazon Reviews](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac6a483a-3aca-464c-98a0-61cddcc0854f)


Unlock the insights hidden in Amazon product reviews with this comprehensive sentiment analysis project. By leveraging machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), this project aims to classify reviews as positive or negative, providing valuable insights into customer sentiments.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to performing sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews. The project uses a Logistic Regression model trained on pre-processed review text to predict whether a review is positive or negative.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare raw review text for analysis using Python libraries like `nltk` and `pandas`.
- **Model Training**: Train a Logistic Regression model to classify the sentiment of reviews.
- **Visualization**: Generate word clouds and confusion matrices to visualize the distribution of sentiments and model performance.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model accuracy with metrics like accuracy score and confusion matrix.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **`az_senti_analysis.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook that contains the full workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- **`data/`**: Directory to store the Amazon review dataset.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of Python libraries required to run the project.
